# CNN-Based-Bionic-Bee

Project for CNN application

## Environment
* System OS : windows 10
* Python : Python 3.6.2
* Keras : Keras 2.0.8

## Introduction
We create this project to apply CNN(Convolution Neural Network), using keras backend tensorflow to construct our network.
Our network are using 5 layers of convolution + maxpooling and 1 layer of fully connected (dense layer). Â 
We try to using CNN to control Drone, making it self control without human.
Further more we want to make this drone can find flowers and recognize its species using CNN.

## Now Progress
Now we can make the drone fly automatically by about 10 meters long in the hallway.
Following link is a video example.

Next step we try to add the flower recognition system on the drone.
